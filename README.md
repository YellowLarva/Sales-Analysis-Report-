## Overview 

A sales analysis Report is a detailed report that shows a business's sales performance, as well as customer data and generated revenue. 
The report defines the strengths and weaknesses of products and sales teams by referencing historical and current metrics to detect emerging trends that are most relevant to a company.

In this Report I have shown QoQ growth % (as a tooltips when hovered on QoQ growth chart) , MoM growth % (as a tooltips when hovered on MoM growth profit chart), Average revenue per day, top sales Person, top product and its subcategory revenue, its gross profit and Revenue generated by the company filtered by year, month and country.

For better understanding the sales report I have made a datemaster table which filter data by limiting date specified which are used in year paremeter and month name parameter.
